# AI-Basics 🤖

Welcome to the AI-Basics project! This project aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to basic Machine Learning (ML) concepts. Whether you're a beginner or looking to refresh your knowledge, AI-Basics has got you covered. 🚀

## Project Overview 🌟

AI-Basics is a collection of Jupyter notebooks that cover fundamental Machine Learning concepts. These notebooks are designed to be interactive and educational, guiding you through the concepts step-by-step. The project is divided into different modules, each focusing on a specific topic.

## ML Concepts covered 📑

1. Introduction to Machine Learning 🤓
2. Data Preprocessing 📊
3. Linear Regression 📈
4. Classification Techniques 📝
5. Clustering Algorithms 🌌
6. Neural Networks and Deep Learning 🧠

## Getting Started 🚗

To get started with AI-Basics, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SinoLewis/ai-basics.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Folder**:

   ```bash
   cd ai-basics
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment**:
   We recommend using a virtual environment. Create one and install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   virtualenv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebooks**:
   Launch Jupyter in your browser and explore the notebooks:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. **Use Local and Google Colab Notebooks**:
   You can run the notebooks locally or on Google Colab for free. Links to Colab notebooks are provided in each module.

## Jupyter Notebooks Cheeat Sheet 🚀

### Setup 🧠

1. Install Python: If Python is not already installed on your Debian system, you can install it using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3
```

2. Install Jupyter Notebook: You can install Jupyter Notebook using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install jupyter-notebook
```

3. Start Jupyter Notebook:

> By default, the Jupyter Notebook server runs on port 8888.

````bash
jupyter-notebook --port=8000```
````
