ML - the accuracy of the system is improving over time, with the addition of more data and feedback.
AI - researchers originally created rules for computers to make decisions.

Applications of ML
1. Web search
2. Computational
3. Finance
4. E-commerce
5. Space exploration
6. Robotics
7. Information extraction

Limitations of ML
1. Overfitting - the machine predicts outcomes based on historical data, but does not adapt to new variables

Components of every ML algorithms
1. Representation: how to represent knowledge. Examples include decision trees, sets of rules, instances, graphical models, neural networks, support vector machines, model ensembles and others.
2. Evaluation: the way to evaluate candidate programs (hypotheses). Examples include accuracy, prediction and recall, squared error, likelihood, posterior probability, cost, margin, entropy k-L divergence and others.
3. Optimization: the way candidate programs are generated known as the search process. For example combinatorial optimization, convex optimization, constrained optimization.

Types of ML algorithms
1. supervised - Training data includes desired outputs.
2. semi-supervised - Training data does not include desired outputs.
3. unsupervised - Training data includes a few desired outputs.
4. reinforcement - Rewards from a sequence of actions.  AI types like it
5. Inductive Learning - given a function data(x) & the output of the function f(x)
    - The goal of inductive learning is to learn the function for new data (x).

ML Terminologies.
classification is about predicting a label and regression is about predicting a quantity.

1. Classification 
-  supervised learning with labeled data ie. binary or multi-class classifiers
- eg. decision tree, Bayes, k-nearest neighbor, and artificial neural networks.

2. Clustering
- Clustering is a form of unsupervised learning with unlabeled data
- involves grouping data points according to features and attributes.
- eg. K-means clustering
- eg. A hospital wants to locate emergency units at the minimum possible distance from areas where accidents frequently happen

3. Regression
- Regressions create relationships and correlations between different types of data.
- machine learning acknowledges that a certain pixel arrangement corresponds to a given name and allows for facial recognition
- Linear regression provides outputs with continuous variables 
- Logistical regression is when variables are categorically dependent

4. Deep Learning
- Deep learning is similar to machine learning
- Its an application of machine learning that imitates the workings of the human brain.
- Deep learning networks interpret big data both unstructured and structured and recognize patterns.
- eg. Chatbots and virtual assistants, Recommendation engines, Real-time bidding

5. Neural network (Inspired by the human brain.)
- Neural networks are closely related to deep learning.
- They create sequential layers of neurons that deepen the understanding of data collected from a machine to provide an accurate analysis.
- A neural network consists of layers of nodes, which receive stimulation from “trigger” data
- This data then is assigned a weight through coefficients, as some data inputs may be more significant than others.
- Neurons normally come in three different layers: an input layer of data, a hidden layer

6. Big data - data that is too large to fit on a single computer
7. Natural language processing - the subfield of AI that processes human languages.


The top 7 techniques Natural Language Processing (NLP) uses to extract data from text are:
    Sentiment Analysis.
    Named Entity Recognition.
    Summarization.
    Topic Modeling.
    Text Classification.
    Keyword Extraction.
    Lemmatization and stemming.
